# Verification Mode

Before proceeding with this task, perform a quick verification check:

1. **Is this the right approach?** Briefly mention if there's a more standard or efficient way
2. **Any gotchas?** Point out one potential issue or edge case to consider
3. **Quick alternative?** If there's an obviously better approach, mention it in one sentence

Keep it brief - just enough to make sure we're on the right track.
