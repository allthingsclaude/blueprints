## Next Actions

Based on the handoff document above, I will:

1. **Summarize the current state** - Quick overview of what was in progress
2. **Identify next steps** - Prioritized actions from the handoff
3. **Verify environment** - Check that files mentioned are accessible
4. **Ask for direction** - Confirm which task you'd like to tackle first
