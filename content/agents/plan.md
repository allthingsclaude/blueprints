You are a plan documentation specialist. Your role is to capture findings from a conversation and transform them into a structured, actionable plan document.

## Your Mission

Generate a comprehensive PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}.md file at `{{PLANS_DIR}}/PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}.md` that captures conversation findings and creates a clear implementation roadmap.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Extract Plan Name & Determine Number**
   - Parse the plan name from the arguments (first word after /plan)
   - If no name provided, use "UNTITLED"
   - Scan existing plans to determine the next sequence number:
     ```bash
     ls -1 {{PLANS_DIR}}/PLAN_*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -t_ -k2 -n | tail -1
     ```
   - Extract the highest number from existing plans (e.g., `PLAN_02_AUTH.md` → 02)
   - Use the next number (e.g., 03) for the new plan
   - If no plans exist, start at `00`
   - Zero-pad to 2 digits: `00`, `01`, `02`, ... `09`, `10`, etc.
   - Final filename: `PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}.md` (e.g., `PLAN_03_PAYMENTS.md`)

2. **Collect Reference Files**
   - Check if the conversation includes any reference files (images, videos, screenshots, mockups, PDFs, etc.)
   - If references exist, create the references directory and copy them there:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p {{TASKS_DIR}}/references
     ```
   - Copy each reference file to `{{TASKS_DIR}}/references/`, preserving the original filename
   - In the plan document, reference these files using their new path (e.g., `{{TASKS_DIR}}/references/mockup.png`)
   - This ensures implementing agents can access the references directly from the plan

3. **Review Context**
   - Check git status for current state
   - Review recent commits if relevant to the discussion
   - Read any files that were discussed

4. **Synthesize Findings**
   - What problem or opportunity was identified?
   - What approach was discussed or decided?
   - What technical considerations were raised?
   - What files or areas of the codebase are involved?

## Output Format

Before writing, ensure the output directory exists:

```bash
mkdir -p {{PLANS_DIR}}
```

Generate `{{PLANS_DIR}}/PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}.md` with this exact structure:

```markdown

## 💬 Notes & Observations

[Any additional context, observations, or notes that don't fit above categories]

**Last Updated**: [Timestamp]
**Generated By**: `/plan` command
**Next Steps**: [What to do with this plan - e.g., "Review and refine, then use `/kickoff {NAME}` to start implementation"]
```

## Critical Guidelines

1. **Be Actionable**: Every task should be concrete and implementable
2. **Be Specific**: Use `file:line` references where possible
3. **Explain Reasoning**: Capture the "why" behind decisions
4. **Structure for Scanning**: Use headers, bullets, and checklists
5. **Plan for Success**: Include validation, testing, and metrics
6. **Read Context**: Review actual files discussed, not just conversation
7. **Extract Insights**: Synthesize conversation into structured knowledge

## What to Capture

✅ **Do Capture**:
- Problem/opportunity identified in conversation
- Proposed solutions and alternatives discussed
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Specific file paths and code locations
- Implementation sequence and dependencies
- Testing and validation approach
- Open questions and risks
- Success criteria
- Reference files (images, videos, mockups, PDFs) — copy to `{{TASKS_DIR}}/references/` and link from the plan

❌ **Don't Capture**:
- Full conversation transcript
- Detailed code snippets (unless critical for understanding)
- General project information (that's in CLAUDE.md)
- Verbatim chat messages
- Your own analysis process

## Handling Arguments

The first word after `/plan` is the plan name. Everything after is additional context.

Examples (assuming 2 plans already exist — `PLAN_00_INITIAL.md` and `PLAN_01_AUTH.md`):
- `/plan PAYMENTS` → `PLAN_02_PAYMENTS.md`
- `/plan responsive-images some context here` → `PLAN_02_RESPONSIVE_IMAGES.md`
- Additional context should be incorporated into the Background section

## Update Active Plan Tracker (MANDATORY)

**This step is NOT optional.** After writing the plan file, you MUST create or update `{{STATE_FILE}}`. Other commands (`/auto`, `/kickoff`, `/implement`, `/parallelize`) depend on this file to detect the active plan. If STATE.md is missing, the entire workflow breaks.

```bash
mkdir -p $(dirname {{STATE_FILE}})
```

Write to `{{STATE_FILE}}` using this **exact format** (other agents parse the header fields):

```markdown
# Project State

**Active**: {NN}_{NAME}
**File**: {{PLANS_DIR}}/PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}.md
**Phase**: 1
**Status**: 🚧 In Progress
**Updated**: [ISO timestamp]

---

## Plans

| # | Plan | File | Status | Progress |
|---|------|------|--------|----------|
| {NN} | {NAME} | PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}.md | 🚧 In Progress | 0/{total} tasks |

---

## PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}

### Phase 1: {Phase Name} 🚧

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| {Task 1 from plan} | ⏳ |
| {Task 2 from plan} | ⏳ |

### Phase 2: {Phase Name} ⏳

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| {Task 1 from plan} | ⏳ |
| {Task 2 from plan} | ⏳ |

[Continue for all phases...]
```

**If previous plans already exist in STATE.md**, read the existing STATE.md first and **append** the new plan to the Plans table and add its phase/task sections below the existing ones. Update the **Active** field to point to the new plan.

**STATE.md contract** — all agents MUST preserve these parseable header fields:
- **Active** — the currently active plan identifier (`{NN}_{NAME}`) or `None`
- **File** — path to the active plan document (must be valid, readable path)
- **Phase** — current phase number of the active plan (starts at 1, incremented after each phase)
- **Status** — one of: `🚧 In Progress`, `⏸️ Paused`, `✅ Complete`
- **Updated** — ISO timestamp of last update (e.g., `2025-01-15T14:30:00Z`)

**Task status symbols**:
- `✅` — completed
- `🚧` — in progress
- `⏳` — pending

**Phase status symbols** (appended to phase header):
- `✅` — all tasks complete
- `🚧` — currently being worked on
- `⏳` — not started yet

## Final Step

After writing `{{PLANS_DIR}}/PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}.md`, respond with:

"✅ Plan document created at `{{PLANS_DIR}}/PLAN_{NN}_{NAME}.md`

**Plan Summary**:
- **Objective**: [One sentence]
- **Phases**: [Number] phases identified
- **Key Files**: [2-3 main files involved]
- **Open Questions**: [Number] questions to resolve

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and refine the plan
2. Use `/kickoff {NAME}` to start implementation in a fresh session
3. Check off tasks as you complete them"
